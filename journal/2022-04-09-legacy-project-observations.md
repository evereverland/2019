## Legacy Project Observations


## 1. simple tools for collecting the materia

simple tools for collecting the material: A well-designed web form with prompts for significant memories, vital stats, family medical history, ethical will, and so on; and tools for collecting, tagging, and preserving photos, videos, and other media.

Building web pages to help with gathering data and archiving is certainly doable

On the other hand many people may prefer off-loading the task tp other. Why spend time documenting your life when you could have more fun just living your life.

Creating a new industry around this process may be more efficacious.

## 2. plan for long-term preservation

> Second, tools, tech, and a plan for long-term preservation.

Facebook, GitHub, Flickr and other online services available to users at no cost have yet to delete user data. The photo you sent to Facebook in 2004 i still there. Storing huge amounts of data online for unlimited periods of time is becoming quite cheap.

The interesting aspects will be
* cataloging and tagging the data
* Making it available to AI
* Making it entertaining for humans

## 3. Permission to Access

> Third, a robust system, designed with legal advice, for specifying who gets to access which parts of the legacy and when.

Again, Facebook, GitHub, Flickr and other online services available to users at no cost lead the way in building systems that are hard to hack and have many controls. These examples can be followed,

## 4. Convenient Access to the information

> Fourth, convenient, controlled access to the information.

See also previous item. Just because you have the right password to access the information does not automatically meabn that you may want to access the information. The essential challenge in such a project is to make the data available quickly, easily and delightfully.

All the forces of artificial general intelligence, the metaverse, gaming   and other nascent technologies may be marshaled and wrangled into re-presenting a life in a meaningful manner

## 5. promote the project and its reliability

> Fifth, an effort to promote the project and its reliability.

Every life may be considered a work of art. Some works of art are more outstanding than others.

Every life has definition and patterns. The lives of painter, novelists and business people each have their own trajectories

Every has an inner voice. Some inner voices are nearly mute; others shout non-stop.

There will be a point in time when sufficient remarkable lives are open for gaming. After that there will be no looking back to the time when there was no looking back.
