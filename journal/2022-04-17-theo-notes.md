## "What is remembered lives"

Stephen heard the quote in [Nomadland]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomadland_(film) )

>The title of this, “What’s remembered, lives,” is a quote attributed to the father of Frances McDormand’s character, Fern. It’s a pithy encapsulation of a truth many of us remember when we lose someone close. Fern finds herself trapped in a self-fulfilling cocoon of memory.

Perhaps the quote is derived from this 2-19 book

_What Is Remembered Lives: Developing Relationships with Deities, Ancestors & the Fae_

Phoenix LaFAE's introduction is worth a read.

>In many Pagan traditions, we use the phrase “What is remembered lives.” Often we say this at Samhain, when we are calling out the names of our beloved dead. What is remembered lives is a way of honoring our ancestors, those we knew, those we never met, and even those whose names we have forgotten. By naming what is remembered lives, we speak to the real truth of immortality, because the only way that we could live on we have left our bodies is if we remembered.
