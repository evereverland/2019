# Genealogy Current Thoughts


## Questions

Who is trying to reinvent genealogy? Are there active groups of people who try to re-imagine the purpose and benefits of genealogy? If so, who are they? How do we get in touch with them?

Is there an online forum where people talk about these thing?

## DNA tests

Is 23andme.com good enough? Should you try others? If so, who?


## GEDCOM Rules?

If we are to build stuff for the metaverse and all sorts of future stuff, then we will need "machine readable" sources of data. (Yes, with AI anything can be parsed - but while we are waiting, what to do we do? ). GEDCOM seems to be it.

Is there an app that allows you to copy and paste the text from Norah's email and derive a valid gedcom file?

Once we have a good number of gedcom files, we can do all manner of wonderful things in terms of getting things to appear in the Metaverse! Fingers crossed!

## Personal

How close is George Armour to Jeanne Armour - wife of the Scottish poet Robert Burns?

Is James C Marshall Shirk related to US Chief Justice John Marshall? I hace a painting supposedly of his daughter. A known relationship will be useful in donating the portrait to Marshall's library.
