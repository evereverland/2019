Joshi, reverentially and lovingly known as Pujya Bhai, was born on 4 October 1920 in the town of Junagadh in the Western state of Gujarat, India. Under the loving care and religious upbringing of his parents, he had a happy childhood. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>From a very young age, Pujya Bhai was fond of reading books. Even during his college years, he would read at home for hours after class. He found little interest in what was taught at school, but was intrigued by Indian philosophy, and Western philosophers such as Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, and others. He was also interested in the modern socio-political writings of Karl Marx and contemporary Indian leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Sri Aurobindo, and other freedom fighters. He used to climb the nearby mountain, </span><span class="c1">Girnar</span><span class="c3 c2">, with a stack of books and some snacks in his duffle bag, find a secluded spot, and read until dusk.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">Subsequent to graduating with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree, he had completed all requirements for a Master&rsquo;s program at a local college, but when he went to file an application for the final examination -- the very last step needed to earn a Master&rsquo;s degree in Arts -- he experienced something unexpected and life-altering. As he scaled the last few steps to enter the building, he suddenly felt as if his feet were glued to the concrete steps. He could not proceed any further.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>What must have gone through his mind in this moment? After spending years on his studies how could he come so close to the final qualifying examination and simply stop? It was as if an incomprehensible force was overpowering his will. Instantaneously and with perfect clarity, he realized that his human will was being set aside in favor of the supremely powerful and all-knowing Divine Will. He knew that to attain true happiness and peace in life, he would have to surrender to God in absolute terms. Years later, he wrote about this in </span><span class="c1">Amrutam, </span><span>his eight-volume collection of writings (Chapter titled Inspirations, verse No. 141; hereinafter, all references to Inspirations are from </span><span class="c1">Amrutam, </span><span class="c3 c2">volume 1):</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The attainment of perfect happiness</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is possible only through God.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because God is perfect,</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the world is imperfect.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expectations are many;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all are met</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always a conflict</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the efforts to satisfy desires.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sting of unfilled wants is felt;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mind is disturbed.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Presence of God alone is</span></p><p class="c6 c9"><span class="c1">The highest summit of peace.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">Pujya Bhai now understood the path his life was destined to take. He knew without a doubt that God was redirecting his course. He was not to entertain any worldly ambitions like higher education, or relying on a college degree to earn money to support himself and his parents. He was to live his entire life for a spiritual purpose. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">On those concrete steps, without any hesitation, Pujya Bhai surrendered to this unknown Divine Force. &nbsp;He decided to surrender his psycho-physical existence to a spiritual one. He relinquished the opportunity to appear for the final examination and instead patiently awaited for God&rsquo;s direction for the next chapter in his life.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">Total surrender to the Divine Will became the corner stone of Pujya Bhai&rsquo;s life and teachings from this point on. Years later, he wrote about the importance of true surrender to God in Inspiration No. 145:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Only a person who has unshakeable faith in God</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can be meaningfully surrendered to God.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One who is surrendered </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does not retain the ownership of his actions,</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor does he desire to enjoy the fruits of such actions.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a state of surrender, </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God Himself becomes the sole controller in charge.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surrender to God is the highest form of self-effort.</span></p><p class="c6 c9"><span class="c1">It is also the ultimate accomplishment.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">On 23 May 1943, 22-year old Pujya Bhai was married to a girl named Ramaben (Pujya Ben), who lived in Gondal, a smaller town 65 km from Junagadh. Years later, he told others that he had a premonition that they were destined for each other even before they met. Throughout his youth, Pujya Bhai had intuitive flashes about past, present and future events and could look into the minds and hearts of people. But he would not accept these flashes unchallenged. He would make every attempt to prove to himself that they were not mere illusions.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">In 1946, a momentous event took place in Pujya Bhai&rsquo;s life. He described it as follows:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6 c9"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;On 8 January 1946, between 12:30 and 1:00 PM,&nbsp;I was sitting alone in a room upstairs in&nbsp;my house in Junagadh, when out of nowhere, there was an explosion of&nbsp;Divine energy of such immense magnitude that even the walls of the room shook.&nbsp;One of the&nbsp;dinner plates stacked&nbsp;in the mezzanine fell and rolled along the walls, finally coming to rest against a wall. It was&nbsp;emanating the sound of anklets. A bright light filled the room. My lips turned rose-colored red. Aromas wafted from&nbsp;my fingers for a long time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Pujya Bhai heard a Divine Voice proclaim, &ldquo;I am </span><span class="c2 c1">Amba.....</span><span class="c2 c17">Divinity</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c17">born..... unparalleled ......</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Supreme Power of the Universe</span><span class="c2 c17">.&rdquo;</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;[Amba </span><span class="c2">is short for </span><span class="c2 c1">Jagadamba</span><span class="c3 c2">, the Divine Mother.] &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">In that moment, Pujya Bhai realized that the Divine Mother had manifested. Though She was with him from birth, this was the day when the Divine Mother revealed Herself fully as the Supreme Power and confirmed that She had always been with him and that She was indeed within him to stay. Pujya Bhai told a follower many years later, &ldquo;On that day, Ma declared Herself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">Pujya Bhai has explained this phenomena of Divine Incarnation in Inspiration No. 137: </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The Divine Incarnation is</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The descent of the Supreme Consciousness,</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concretized in a human form.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His arrival is a new dawn for the world.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By His sayings and life He offers a new vision;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brings a message for the present age.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a self-illumined Eternal Lamp,</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighting up innumerable other lamps.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His aroma of sanctity is ever expanding.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a transcendent bridge between </span></p><p class="c6 c9"><span class="c0">Human beings and the Supreme Being.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">Pujya Bhai was later asked, &ldquo;Were you just like us before and on that day you were transformed into a Divine Incarnation?&rdquo; His reply was unequivocal: &ldquo;The Divine Mother wished to remain hidden. On that day, She declared Herself. Prior to that day, I had intuitive flashes but I wasn&rsquo;t fully cognizant of the dual facets of my existence: human and Divine.&rdquo; He then added with a hearty laugh, &ldquo;Otherwise maybe I wouldn&rsquo;t have got married, and would have lost a golden opportunity to be an ordinary householder man like everyone else!&rdquo; Otherwise, he would not have had a Divine companion through marriage. They were to live a married life, have a daughter, live in a modest house like other ordinary people living in the community. This type of life was in itself one of his great teachings for this age.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>When this unique, mystical event took place, Pujya Bhai had been enduring the most excruciating agony imaginable for almost three years. Within about two weeks after his marriage on 23 May 1943, his body was subjected to </span><span class="c1">Vayu, </span><span class="c3 c2">a strange phenomena which is described in the Hindu scriptures as a physical manifestation of the Divine Power occupying a human body. It is a physical process wherein the stomach swiftly exhales a huge amount of air (not gas) with such tremendous force that its stream can reach, and be felt, ten or more feet away. Over the years, numerous doctors have confirmed that this is not a condition that ordinary human beings experience, and that medical science had no explanation for it. It remained with Pujya Bhai continually for his life&rsquo;s remaining 70 years, with brief respites. It required someone to be by his bedside all through the night so that he could be helped to sit up whenever his sleep was interrupted due to a choking sensation, and the pain became excessive. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>For the rest of his life from 1946 onward, Pujya Bhai ate very little, only liquid food: a half cup of vegetable and legume soup, and a half cup of tea with milk. He would drink these in spoonfuls so that they would last the whole day. His body could not manage anything more because of the phenomenon affecting him, </span><span class="c1">Vayu. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">Once someone asked him, &ldquo;For many years you haven&rsquo;t eaten anything solid. The liquid that you drink is just a small amount, not enough to survive on. How do you get your energy?&rdquo; Pujya Bhai replied, &ldquo;Where does food get its energy from?&rdquo; &ldquo;From the Sun.&rdquo; Pujya Bhai said, &ldquo;Who gives energy to the Sun?&rdquo; The person answered, &ldquo;God.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well then, can&rsquo;t the same God give me the energy I need directly?&rdquo; The person found this succinct explanation highly satisfying. He had been agonizing over this riddle for a very long time.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>Pujya Bhai was 22 when this inexplicable phenomena of </span><span class="c1">Vayu</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;first occurred. On and off, from this day on his bed became his usual resting place. The first three years were marked by continuous, excruciating physical pain until the Divine Manifestation transformed his body. During those years, his mother and Pujya Ben were constantly attending to him. He was subjected to many medical tests and &nbsp;doctors&rsquo; visits in order to dispel any doubts in the minds of those close to him that he was not afflicted by any disease, but was experiencing a Divine process, in full accord with the Divine Will. At the same time, he was also showing them by his example that a life lived in total and absolute surrender to the Divine is not a torture but a most desirable spiritual delight. Years later, he wrote in Inspiration No. 21:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Even terrifying calamities are simply </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The compassion-filled openings </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In your finite consciousness </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Created by the boundless Divine Energy,</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that you become aware of </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence and reign of God&#39;s Infinite Power.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c0">That Supreme Sovereign, </span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c0">By beaming dazzling rays of light through these openings,</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will erase the line of separation between you and God, </span></p><p class="c6 c9"><span class="c0">And transform your state of prolonged failures into success.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>In later years, Pujya Bhai explained that </span><span class="c1">Vayu</span><span>&nbsp;was not a sickness or a physical oddity, but a concrete form of the Divine Energy residing in his body for the purpose of Divine work. His body was to be sacrificed, undergoing indescribable agonies for the rest of his life so that this Divine phenomena could extend its spiritual mantle over the world and usher in a new age of the worship of the Divine Mother as the Supreme Power. This was to be the </span><span class="c1">Yug-Sandesh:</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;a spiritual message for the new age that was dawning.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>In order to follow and integrate in our lives this </span><span class="c1">Yug-Sandesh </span><span>-- the message for the new age, Pujya Bhai spoke of three requisites: </span><span class="c1">Smaran, Sharan, </span><span>and </span><span class="c1">Charan.</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>By </span><span class="c1">Smaran </span><span>he meant </span><span class="c1">Nam-Smaran, </span><span class="c3 c2">unceasing repetition of the Divine Names. This was Pujya Bhai&rsquo;s preferred spiritual practice to be used by all who aspired to the union with God through love. In Inspiration No. 20, he says:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c11"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">You are not a pauper.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only he who is averse to Nam-Smaran</span><span class="c12 c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">of God</span><span class="c12 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c0">Is impoverished and unfortunate.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c0">His deprivation is painful.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c0">In remembrance of God, poverty of all sorts is effaced.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>An essential companion to </span><span class="c1">Nam-Smaran</span><span>&nbsp;is prayer, about which Pujya Bhai has written extensively in </span><span class="c1">Amrutam. </span><span class="c3 c2">For instance, in Inspiration No. 100:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When your helpless existence, </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resembling a raindrop fluttering in the wind,</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trembles in the gust of worldliness,</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prayer will make God, the Ocean of Grace, eager to meet you.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">Further in Inspiration No. 129:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Prayer is heart&rsquo;s longing for union with God;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a sage-blessed mantra, </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is infused with Divine Consciousness.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stream of thought focused on God is like </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A filament of smoke rising up from an incense stick.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prayer for a worldly need also has a place:</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God gives an appropriate response.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God showers His Grace upon the soul of </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who prays for no worldly favors,</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And softens various layers of his consciousness.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That prayer is best when offered solely</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the union with God.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>Since the practice of </span><span class="c1">Nam-Smaran</span><span>&nbsp;and prayer needed a framework for a new, spiritual way of living, Pujya Bhai spoke of the second requisite: </span><span class="c1">Sharan, </span><span>surrender to God. This</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c2">can only be partial in the beginning, he said. Through constant awareness of ego&rsquo;s grip on our daily activities and interactions with people, we can begin to surrender to the Divine Will, and open ourselves to receive the Divine Grace. Pujya Bhai explained that surrender to God was not to be a mechanical process. He points to its mystical significance in Inspiration No. 50: </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">For someone, </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is absolutely surrendered to God,</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is the way and</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is the end as well.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>The third requisite, </span><span class="c1">Charan, </span><span class="c3 c2">literally means &ldquo;feet&rdquo;. &nbsp;To take refuge at the Divine feet is to receive the Divine Grace. On numerous occasions, Pujya Bhai had said that our self-efforts are incomplete and finite, while God is Infinite. They are not sufficient in themselves for attaining pure love of God. In Inspiration No. 62 he says:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selfless love for God </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is not attainable through self-effort;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is gained through the Grace of God.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">The mysticism of the Divine Grace, as the means and the end, is hinted at in Inspiration No. 142:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">His divine, unbroken Flow of Immortal Life, </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the comprehension of this auspicious vision </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are dependent solely upon His Grace.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>(Further references to these three requisites are found in numerous verses of </span><span class="c1">Amrutam</span><span>&rsquo;s eight volumes.)</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">From the Divine Manifestation Day, Pujya Bhai freely shared his Divine attributes: Wisdom, Power and Compassion. He was able to see the past, present and future, and events occurring at, near, or far distances. Once when a visitor had doubted his supernatural powers, he stopped the pendulum of a clock that was in the next room without getting up from his seat, asked the person to confirm that it had indeed stopped, and then he restarted the clock in the visitor&rsquo;s presence to his amazement.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">He once said, &ldquo;The entire universe is an open book to me because the Divine Mother pervades everywhere. She is in the smallest atomic particle as much as in the universes at large.&rdquo; But he did not abandon his ordinary human qualities and limitations. They were self-imposed in the context of his Divinity. However, he always remained equally true and faithful to both of his facets: humanity and Divinity.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">He said that since he was a rational being, he used to check and recheck his state of mind to make sure he was not indulging in flights of fancy when great powers and attributes shone through him. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">Over a span of more than six decades, thousands of people -- both true followers and those who came to see him merely out of curiosity -- experienced Pujya Bhai&rsquo;s miraculous powers in their lives. He spontaneously cured grave diseases like cancer and heart ailments, and many found freedom from mental sicknesses and relief from financial or social worries after visiting him. He explained that such miracles are merely the tangible signs of God&rsquo;s Grace and power, and God&rsquo;s love for us. Miracles are meant to make us humble and bring us closer to God. Over the years, many of his followers have written personal diaries, as yet only a few have been published, documenting conversations with Pujya Bhai and about the miraculous transformations brought about in their lives by the power of his Divinity. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">More tangible than the miracles, was Pujya Bhai&rsquo;s unparalleled love showered on all those who visited him. His followers would travel long distances, even from overseas, for a life-altering touch of this Divine love and to experience his Divine Presence. Rationality cannot comprehend the transformation in consciousness that took place through such visits. This would transport the visitors onto a higher plane of spiritual experience where a miracle would appear as a mere adjunct to his love for them.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>Divinity would at times remain hidden behind the cloak of Pujya Bhai&rsquo;s humanity, and at other times it would be out in front for all to see and experience, and be awed and blessed by it. But Pujya Bhai never implied that such access to Divine Grace was exclusive to anyone. Instead, he invariably attributed everything that was occurring in his life to the Divine Mother and encouraged others to attain the same through a loving relationship with Her. In</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c2">Inspiration No. 139 he wrote:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Instantly upon the annihilation of ego</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doors to the realm of Eternity are opened.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infinite space is unveiled.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new dawn begins in life.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When anchored in the Infinite,</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finite boundaries vanish.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real breeze of freedom is gained.</span></p><p class="c6 c9"><span class="c1">The immortal shower of Bliss begins.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c21"><span>Pujya Bhai and Pujya Ben were setting an example of how to maintain a strong family life under harsh living conditions. &nbsp;From the start of their marriage on 23 May 1943, they lived under extreme poverty. Yet Pujya Bhai never engaged in making money through &ldquo;spiritual consultations&rdquo; or being a &ldquo;</span><span class="c1">Guru</span><span>&rdquo;. Once during a conversation, Pujya Bhai told a follower that he was not a preacher, a philosopher, a poet, a religious reformer or anybody&rsquo;s </span><span class="c1">Guru</span><span class="c3 c2">, nor was he a member or an official of any religious group or institution. The follower asked, &ldquo;Then what should you be known as?&rdquo; He simply replied, &ldquo;A spiritual being.&rdquo; Pujya Bhai has repeatedly said over the years that his path, his teachings are non-sectarian because God is above and beyond all sects and religions. </span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">Pujya Bhai&rsquo;s attendant handled any offerings that were made by visitors. He took no interest in his own financial matters. Instead, he made himself freely available to all who wanted his spiritual guidance or Divine intervention to resolve their personal problems. He would stay at home, never venturing out. He bound the journalists and writers who came to see him by a promise not to publish any articles, interviews or books about him. Likewise, his followers refrained from publicizing their good fortune, in deference to his wishes. People would come to him as the word of mouth began to spread about his Divine powers. Miracles began to take place in the lives of many, at the physical and spiritual level, without limitations imposed by cast, creed, race or religion.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">Soon after his mother had passed away, in 1946 Pujya Bhai and Pujya Ben moved to Gondal. Their daughter, Indiraben, was later born there. In 1962, they moved to a new house named &ldquo;Shruti&rdquo;, where Pujya Bhai lived almost all of his remaining life. Pujya Ben passed away on 6 July 1994 in a Mumbai hospital where she had been taken for cancer treatment. Pujya Bhai had traveled from Gondal, despite his poor health, to be by her side in the hospital when she passed away.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">Pujya Bhai, having surrendered absolutely to the Divine Will, always accepted the advice of doctors, without any resistance, in the case of Pujya Ben&rsquo;s or his own health. He used to say that doctors, medications and patients are all manifestations of the same Divine Consciousness and, therefore, the entire process of disease and its successful or unsuccessful treatment reflects nothing but the Divine Will.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">On 4 July 2011, Pujya Bhai was transferred for a while to a hospital in Ahmedabad, the largest city in Gujarat, where modern medical facilities were available. A staff of experienced doctors and specialists took care of Pujya Bhai&rsquo;s health until he left his mortal body on 19 May 2013. He had fully surrendered to the medical team and had given them complete freedom. The doctors felt blessed to be serving Pujya Bhai and were witnesses to many miracles. Even in the midst of excruciating physical suffering, he welcomed visitors to his bedside with his enchanting smile and inquired about their well-being. During his final days,&nbsp;he often was unable to speak to them, because his body was too frail to cope with the strain.&nbsp;But he never complained about his physical condition.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2 c3"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">His body was brought to Gondal and was cremated on 21 May on the same spot where Pujya Ben&rsquo;s body had been cremated. There is a small memorial shrine, called </span><span class="c2 c1">Smruti Mandir, </span><span class="c2">on that spot adjoining </span><span class="c2 c1">Shri Jagadamba</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Temple.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>From 1946 onward, Pujya Bhai relied on the offerings and donations of his followers and visitors to provide for the basic necessities of life. At the same time, he remained faithful and true to his Humanity; he functioned with his body and mind, and allowed himself to be subjected to the laws of Nature. He explained that all Divine Incarnations through the ages, among all religions, were the human embodiments of the same Supreme Being -- God. &nbsp;The only differences between these Incarnations could be explained by the prevailing culture and teachings necessary for the particular age in which they lived. Their human limitations were neither fake nor a hindrance to their Divine manifestations.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span>After Pujya Bhai moved to &ldquo;</span><span class="c1">Shruti&rdquo;, </span><span class="c3 c2">his life became more &ldquo;open to the public&rdquo;; and many more spiritual seekers and visitors sought him, especially for personal conversations. Pujya Bhai never went out to give lectures but he did not hold back his teachings or insights from anyone. Though he mostly spoke in his own language, Gujarati, he was fluent in English and many other languages as well, some through Divine knowledge. For instance, once with a follower from Africa, he held a conversation in Swahili, a language he could not have known. He explained later that the Divine Mother spoke through him.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">In 1956, Pujya Bhai set up a charitable Trust named &ldquo;Shri Bhagavat Sadhan Sangh&rdquo;, which had begun to provide free lodging and meals to the visitors, many of whom would stay for several weeks at a time. No one was ever asked to pay, but if they wished to contribute toward the expenses, they could do so anonymously in a small box placed on a wall in a one-story structure behind &ldquo;Shruti&rdquo;. This was also the place where the visitors would stay overnight and enjoy their communal meals.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">Pujya Bhai lived the life he taught. He frequently said that we are to transform ourselves from psycho-physical beings to spiritual beings -- a sentiment he often expressed in his writings.

class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">Through his own example that a modern human being can emulate, Pujya Bhai showed that the ultimate goal of life is the mystical union with God through a loving relationship based on absolute and total surrender to God. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">To help us build this loving relationship with God as our Divine Mother, Pujya Bhai drew our attention to the child-mother relationship. In Inspiration No. 111, first he describes what childlike simplicity is:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Life&#39;s unblemished glow is delightful.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Childlike simplicity is devoid of friction.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flowers&#39; beauty and fragrance are their essential nature.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nightingale&rsquo;s song is an impulse of contentment.</span></p><p class="c6 c9"><span class="c1">In the light of the stars lies their natural smile.</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">Then in Inspiration No. 106, he says:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Brother!</span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The clouds of the lunar month of Ashadh, </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bulging with water and bowing low, </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soak the earth and make it fertile and green.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Divine Mother too, </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carrying Infinite Compassion and bowing low,</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifts up the children who are depraved, helpless and mired in muck,</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And makes them loving and pure.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">In Inspiration No. 53, Pujya Bhai offers advice for enduring periods of indecision or inner conflict, or trying to find a way out of some unsettling situation:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">O Brother!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When reasoning provides you no satisfactory solution,</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead creates billows of smoke, </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, like an untutored child,</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take refuge in the lap of</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The All-Knowing Divine Mother.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall gain both inner peace and the satisfactory solution.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">In order to answer the question, &ldquo;How can one create a loving relationship with God?&rdquo; Pujya Bhai writes in Inspiration No. 54:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Your personal, egocentric self-effort </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cannot achieve God-realization.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a union with the Infinite Being</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such effort is utterly trivial and insignificant;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But your humble, complete surrender </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall invariably draw God closer to you.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">As we see from all his conversations and writings, surrender to God was the single most important topic. That was the foundation of Pujya Bhai&rsquo;s life and teachings, which he emphasized to his visitors and followers as an essential requirement of spiritual life. He was keen on showing the beneficial spiritual effects of surrender to God as well; these were not mere intellectual concepts gleaned from books. As a Divine Incarnation -- one who embodied Divine Consciousness with Its Supreme Wisdom, Power and Love to the fullest -- Pujya Bhai could say these things with spiritual authority, as he does in Inspiration No. 125:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The moments of complete surrender </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touch the Divine realm of Eternity;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immerse one in Its Infinite Existence.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the juncture of this realization,</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oppressive memories are erased and</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burden of imagined worries is lifted.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the flight of the free bird in the light;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The self-revealed song of Consciousness;</span></p><p class="c6 c9"><span class="c0">The exultant swells of the ocean of Bliss.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">At the same time, Pujya Bhai laid out a natural and effective path for achieving a state of surrender and love for God, wherein two things need to occur simultaneously: Self-effort and Divine Grace. He advised us to be receptive to the Divine Grace while trying to acquire basic virtues, since ultimately our progress is through the Divine Grace and not through self-effort. Though our efforts are important and essential, they count for nothing compared to the Divine Grace, which he wrote about in Inspiration No. 62:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Selfless love for God </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is not attainable through self-effort;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is gained through the Grace of God.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">Receiving such Grace was called &ldquo;The Divine Mother&rsquo;s Touch&rdquo; by Pujya Bhai&rsquo;s followers, after which we are to follow our spiritual path with constant vigilance and firm faith. He used to say that all religions have saints, prophets and mystics who can be the lamp-posts on our spiritual paths.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">Pujya Bhai&rsquo;s teachings on sin and eternal damnation were very clear. He described acts that might normally be labeled as &ldquo;sinful&rdquo; as errors of judgment. For instance, in Inspiration No. 19, he wrote:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Every human being is fully entitled to </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attainment of Divine Perfection.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sin is not an eternal stigma.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the drifting clouds of spiritual ignorance disperse,</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One regains the awareness of the Inner Self.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">On the subject of religions, Pujya Bhai emphasized that all religions, if practiced correctly and sincerely, lead to the same God. Speaking metaphorically he said, &ldquo;On a bicycle wheel, there are many spokes but all of them lead to the one and only hub. If you are on one spoke, and someone entices you to come to his spoke because he says it is better, you will need to go back to the circumference and then travel down his spoke. You would have wasted the precious little time God has given you in this life. But if you had stayed on your course, you would have reached the hub sooner.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">For this reason, Pujya Bhai was against religious conversions and missionary work with that purpose. He was born a Hindu. To him, Hinduism was a universal religion since it encompassed all paths that lead to the same God, whether God with form or without. Hinduism allows the worship and veneration of all Divine Incarnations, prophets, saints and sages of all religions. However, he never said that Hinduism -- or any other religion -- could claim the shortest spoke to the hub -- God.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>All religions, Pujya Bhai said, teach us to cultivate a similar set of virtues. In a benediction at the opening of &ldquo;</span><span class="c1">Smruti Mandir&rdquo;</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;on 12 January 2000, he spoke of &nbsp;six virtues: Detachment from worldliness, Compassion, Patience, Tolerance, Generosity and Penance.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">These did not constitute a regimented set of rules or practices to be followed, but a practical guide to rising above worldliness, and to making our lives virtuous, pure, loving and suitable for the Divine Mother to establish Herself within our hearts.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">In the same benediction, Pujya Bhai showed how one should pray:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c11"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">I pray to the Divine from the depth of my heart that:</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c11 c9"><span class="c0">May we be blessed with those noble qualities;</span></p><p class="c11 c9"><span class="c0">May we become fully virtuous;</span></p><p class="c11 c9"><span class="c0">May we spend the remainder of our lives surrendered at Thy feet;</span></p><p class="c11 c9"><span class="c0">May we become humble, tolerant and endowed with spiritual light;</span></p><p class="c11 c9"><span class="c0">May we be engaged in relieving the sufferings of others;</span></p><p class="c11 c9"><span class="c0">May we fulfill the purpose of our lives; and</span></p><p class="c11 c9"><span class="c0">May we feel the gratitude for life at the time of our departure.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c11 c9"><span class="c0">It is my prayer that such noble sentiments become permanent in our hearts.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>Pujya Bhai knew that the spiritual practices often prescribed in </span><span class="c1">ashrams, </span><span>monasteries, or hermitages tended to leave a practitioner devoid of joy of life. Also, due to ethical pitfalls and moral degradations likely to occur in such settings, he disapproved of the establishment of any</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;ashrams</span><span class="c3 c2">. But he did not frown upon those spiritual seekers who lived like a hermit in a properly supervised hermitage. He wrote in Inspiration No. 14:</span></p><p class="c5 c8"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Intense renunciation and severe austerities </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes make a spiritual seeker </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dull, lopsided and ego-centric.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c0">Tenderness of love and </span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c0">Humility of true surrender </span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c0">Annihilate egotism;</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c0">Also they bring about sweet balance </span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c1">In spiritual discipline and life.</span></p><p class="c5 c8"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3 c2">Pujya Bhai also taught by pointing to the journey within. Inspiration No. 13 says:</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">If you would search your soul with impartial eyes,</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c0">Your shortcomings will begin to fade like the stars at dawn.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a powerful means for reaching the ultimate destination.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3 c2">And again in Inspiration No. 4:</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">If a person drunk with the wine of egotism were </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To gaze patiently in the direction of the cosmos, </span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c0">He would vividly realize his own insignificance.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c0">Whereas, in the lethal moments of helplessness and pessimism, </span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c0">If he were to glance at the infinite potency of his soul,</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c0">His self-confidence and courage would be awakened.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>Pujya Bhai explained the Divine nature of the soul and its relationship to the Supreme Being. He provided clarity on some of the most knotty questions of theology. In several schools of Indian philosophy, a distinction is made between &nbsp;the spiritual practices pursued through the intellect and the heart: the path of knowledge (</span><span class="c1">Gyan</span><span>) and the path of devotion (</span><span class="c1">Bhakti</span><span class="c3 c2">). When intellectually curious visitors wanted to know which of these paths was best, Pujya Bhai explained that both are adequate as long as we are prepared to practice them and not just talk about them. He discouraged philosophical and theological discussions where arguments and counter-arguments would inevitably arise with no end in sight. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">However, Pujya Bhai&rsquo;s teachings had a clear preference for the mystical practice of devotion. In Inspiration Nos. 60 and 61, he wrote:</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The intellect and the mind can lead a person </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to the garden of God&#39;s temple,</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for a glimpse of the Deity, </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enshrined in the innermost sanctum,</span></p><p class="c11 c9"><span class="c1">A pure tender heart is absolutely essential.</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(60)</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The attainment of Divine knowledge</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Culminates in deep peace that exists on its own;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas in the mystical practice of devotion to God,</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are ever-fresh, ever-expanding</span></p><p class="c11 c9"><span class="c1">Ripples of love existing at the mercy of the Beloved.</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(61)</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>In numerous conversations and extensive writings, Pujya Bhai showed that he viewed mysticism as a way of life and a preferable spiritual practice. Mystics of all religions were his favorites. He often spoke about </span><span class="c1">Meera </span><span>(1498-1547), a mystic poetess of Western India, and </span><span class="c1">Aandal, </span><span>a 10</span><span class="c12">th </span><span>century woman saint of South India. He spoke equally extensively to the followers of other religions about the lives and spiritual practices of their mystics such as </span><span class="c1">Jalal-ud-Din Rumi</span><span>&nbsp;(1207-1273),</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Hafez </span><span class="c3 c2">(1325-1389), St. Francis of Assisi (1181-1226) and St. Teresa of Avila (1515-1582), among others.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">This is not to say that Pujya Bhai was averse to great philosophers of the West and the East and their contributions to the realm of spirituality. He often talked about Socrates (470 BC - 399 BC), Plato (424 BC - 348 BC), Adi Shankaracharya and others. But his focus remained on concrete steps for achieving loving relationship with God and not getting derailed along the way by mere philosophical and theological discussions. For instance, when asked whether people should consider God with or without form, Pujya Bhai had this to say in Inspiration No. 78:</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The Divine with attributes or without,</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with form or formless --</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are different facets of the one and only Supreme Reality.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience is relative to the spiritual seeker&rsquo;s longing</span><span class="c3 c2">.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Pujya Bhai used to also address the Supreme Reality as </span><span class="c2 c1">Ma </span><span class="c2">(the Divine Mother). &nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c1">Ma </span><span class="c3 c2">was all there was, and had become everything, whether God was called by any name, male or female. To someone who claimed there is no God, Pujya Bhai would respond, &ldquo;But you do exist, don&rsquo;t you? And you are getting your nourishment from Nature, aren&rsquo;t you? Thus, you do accept the existence of Nature. But I say, Nature too is God.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">God had become the Creation, but was also distinct from it. This mystical &nbsp;concept of differentiation and simultaneous non-differentiation was not a subject Pujya Bhai liked to discuss, since it required the visitor to have existential experience and not just philosophical knowledge. But it clearly shows up in his writings, such as in Inspiration No. 189:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Oneness is intrinsic in the apparently differentiated multiplicity. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Differentiation is just a state of reality on the surface;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the core, the reality is undifferentiated Oneness!</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">Pujya Bhai rejected the notion that the Creation was an illusion. Instead, he said it was very real, since it too was a form of the Divine. He addresses this in Inspiration No. 142:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c1">From time immemorial</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flow of life has been continuing </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a pair of opposites.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Divine Flow is highly mysterious.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God Himself has become the Flow.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">He took interest in all sublime and inspiring aspects of life. He was fond of listening to classical music, both Indian and Western, vocal and instrumental. Among the Western composers, Bach, Beethoven and Mozart were his favorites. His favorite Indian musicians included the maestros of </span><span class="c2 c1">sitar, sarod, sarangi, veena </span><span class="c3 c2">and flute, along with several Indian classical singers. He himself was an exceptional singer. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Pujya Bhai also showed deep interest in the scientific and medical discoveries and would discuss them with interested visitors. He</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;had great respect for science and the scientists. He also loved fine art, such as painting and music, as well as poetry. He once said, &ldquo;Science is the search for Truth. Spirituality is the experience of Truth. Art is the expression of Truth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Pujya Bhai wrote about the inspired artists of all genres in Inspiration No. 146:</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="c2 c1">A poet, traveling on the way to the Supreme Being;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sculptor, manifesting Divine Beauty from a rough-hewn stone;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A musician, catching transcendent sound of music;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A painter, drawing enchanting scenes from the unseen Nature:</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these are sages sitting on the shore of</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unfathomable ocean of mysteries, and</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Living in the mystical experience of</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The One who is Supreme Delight.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abundant sweetness overflows from their extraordinary contentment.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the world receives immortal creations;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the absence of an ulterior motive fills the air with a sweet glow.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Pujya Bhai&rsquo;s love of Nature was exceptionally inspiring because it was always a pointer to something sublime and mystical.

Through these and numerous other references to Nature mentioned in </span><span class="c2 c1">Amrutam</span><span class="c2">, Pujya Bhai was teaching us that, &ldquo;</span><span class="c2 c1">to dive deep into the mysteries of Nature&rsquo;s beauty is to annihilate the aridity of consciousness and to profoundly enrich the soul.&rdquo;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp; Thus, Nature can also assist us in our spiritual practices by constantly reminding us of the Supremely Beautiful One.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>The spiritual practice Pujya Bhai taught, </span><span class="c1">Nam-Smaran, </span><span>was based on the unceasing repetition of the Divine Names. This included any Divine Name or </span><span class="c1">Mantra </span><span>that suited the spiritual seeker&rsquo;s mental makeup. He never initiated anyone or assigned anyone a </span><span class="c1">Mantra</span><span>. When someone once wanted to talk about the pros and cons of different Divine Names and </span><span class="c1">Mantras</span><span>, he immediately responded, &ldquo;If God can hear the footsteps of an ant, don&rsquo;t you think He could hear you? And wouldn&rsquo;t He know that by any Divine Name or </span><span class="c1">Mantra </span><span class="c3 c2">you are calling Him alone?&rdquo; He encouraged spontaneity in our approach to God, a child-like simplicity and letting God guide our steps. He said that if we take even one step toward God, God will take ten steps toward us.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">Pujya Bhai once explained his teaching of unceasing repetition of the Divine Names by saying, &ldquo;The Divine Name itself is supremely conscious, because the Name, and the Entity the Name is pointing to, are undifferentiated in consciousness. The Name is a transcendent sound. That sound invariably affects our consciousness, which then results in its integral transformation through sublimation, not suppression. The Name brings down God&rsquo;s Compassion upon us. His motherly love, His nearness, His Infinite Power begin to unfold and touch us from within. The Name creates Divine vibrations which in turn put an end to our disharmonious consciousness. But for that to happen, we have to have firm faith in the Name. Ultimately, we go beyond the Name; we transcend the Name, and enter into a state of Divine Bliss -- we become one with God through Divine Love. But all of this is dependent upon Divine Grace.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>Pujya Bhai never let the most essential element of spiritual practice escape his followers&rsquo; attention: surrender to God. In numerous verses of </span><span class="c1">Amrutam,</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;spread over six volumes, he repeatedly explained the nature and necessity of true surrender to God. He asserted that surrender is not a concept to be studied, but is a practical way of forming a union with God. It can only be practiced and achieved by a person of firm faith in God and through His Grace.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">In Inspiration No. 79 Pujya Bhai contrasts surrender to human desires:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Surrender to God</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is an opening for receiving the Light;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desires intensify darkness.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surrender secures union with the Infinite;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desires raise a wall against that union.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surrender opens the door to liberation;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desires create the shackles of bondage.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surrender allows the current of love to flow;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desires dry up that flow.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">Again in Inspiration No. 128, he strikes a similar note:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Spirituality is a mark of great beauty in life;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aversion to God is complete unsightliness.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life in tune with God is a song;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existence separated from God is lamentation.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life in the Presence of God is a dance;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eclipsed by egotism, it is aimless wandering.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life centered on God is spontaneous;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shackled to desires, it is a sickness.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total dependence on God is the finest art-form.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">As mentioned, Pujya Bhai gave huge importance to having faith. In his writings, firm faith in God is described as the starting point as well as the ultimate step in one&rsquo;s spiritual journey. Inspiration Nos. 51 and 55:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Faith is the wick of the lamp of Divine Knowledge.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faith is the treasure of Divine Energy.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faith is the lifeboat.</span></p><p class="c6 c9"><span class="c1">It will surely ferry you to the shore of the Infinite.</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(51)</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The pride of piety pushes a person away from God,</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas sincere repentance by the worst fallen soul,</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has unshakeable faith in God&rsquo;s infinite compassion,</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brings him closer to God, and even bestows union with God.</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(55)</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">In order to understand the totality of Pujya Bhai&rsquo;s teachings, we need to know what he had to say on the vast and sometimes divisive subject of God. He urged us to go beyond the narrow confines of religious dogmas and theologies that attempt to define or describe the existence and nature of God. Instead he pointed us in a different direction. He explained that Creation is the partial Consciousness of the Creator. &nbsp;There was a difference between Creation and the Creator, and at the same time there was none, as in the case of a burning log and its spark. The universe is created, maintained and finally dissolved by the Creator, as a part of Divine Play, entirely for the sake of Divine Bliss. Giving a metaphor, in Inspiration No. 105, Pujya Bhai wrote:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The universe is the eternal song of the Immortal Poet.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its every verse throbs Poet&rsquo;s Consciousness.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its manifest state or otherwise,</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its music and harmony are never extinguished. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Creator, with His glance, were to beam Divine Light</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the screen of our soul, we could attain the true vision.</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>If one wants to fathom the depth of Pujya Bhai&rsquo;s mystical sayings on the subject of God, one needs to study all eight volumes of </span><span class="c1">Amrutam. </span><span class="c3 c2">(The subject is too vast to be dealt with here.)</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">However, it is pertinent to note that Pujya Bhai&rsquo;s writings and conversations expressed total openness to God&rsquo;s infinite possibilities. He never wrote or said that God was or was not a human being, or that God could have only one Incarnation and no more, or that God could or could not have form or attributes, and so on. In short, he taught that though God was inscrutable and incomprehensible through our intellect, He was available to us to be experienced as an existential, ecstatic experience of a mystic. And yet, God was even beyond all that we human beings can ever experience or fathom. That is why Pujya Bhai directed our attention to the primacy of the heart over the intellect.</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Pujya Bhai built a temple to the Divine Mother, </span><span class="c2 c1">Shri Jagadamba, </span><span class="c3 c2">in order to provide a suitable place for the mystical practice of devotion to God. Though a specific image of the one and only Supreme Being has been consecrated in this temple, it is not meant to be a Hindu God, it is the Universal God, in the form of the Mother, the Supreme Power of the Universe. This Deity is a physical representation of all other manifestations of God which are limitless and profoundly diverse. Pujya Bhai used to tell the visitors that his teachings were non-sectarian and that they were devoid of religious divisions and dogmas. They embraced all religions, but without any limitations placed on the Supreme Reality. For this very reason, Christians, Muslims and those of other faiths are among his followers.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">Speaking of the importance of visiting places of pilgrimage and spiritual beings for their blessings, Pujya Bhai explained, &ldquo;Surrounding every spiritual place or a spiritual being, there is a spiritual zone -- an aura -- filled with spiritual vibrations. If you go near, it will invariably affect you. If we go near fire, we feel the heat; our cold dissipates. But if we go near a pile of ashes, we only get smeared with ashes!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">In conclusion, a few verses from Inspirations are presented below on the question of how to live. This was often on the minds of the visitors and followers who used to visit with Pujya Bhai in his room. In simple terms, he would teach them how to conduct ourselves while fulfilling their duties within their families and society, and at the same time remain fully engaged in their spiritual practices. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Do not make your mind restless and impure</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By finding faults in others.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire world is a Divine Play </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the one and only incomparable God.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the guise of diversity, that same Supreme Being is at play.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the most despicable character,</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same Beloved is play-acting in a highly strange manner.</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(23)</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any tendency or activity meant to bring</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An object or a person under your control </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will make you dependent on something or someone.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you were to remain dependent on God alone, </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You would become fully independent.</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(91)</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><div><p class="c22"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6 c10"><span class="c3 c2">11/29/2016</span></p></div></body></html>
