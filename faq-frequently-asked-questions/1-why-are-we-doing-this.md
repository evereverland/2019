# Why are we doing this?


## Suggested 'calls to action'

Descriptions or typical subtitles or slogans or jingles for what we do. It wil be nice to have a few nice catchphrases about what we do. Here is a start

* Tools to help you create your afterlife
* Do you want to live forever?
* The search for eternal life, through data collecting and tracking
* Death 2.0 - interaction with your death
* Design your afterlife
* How will you live in the future?
* What does your future life look like
* New homes for old things
* There is no end to this
* "The End" may be a new start


## What is the EverEverLand mission and vision?

What are a dozen sentences or so that cover what we want to do now (the mission ) and a few more sentences about where we see the project providing some future benefit or nicety ( the vision )

We will need messages designed for different audiences: the public, the "insiders", the programmers and more. Here os a start - mostly for insiders.

### Mission

* To capture, preserve, index and make readily available forever at no charge to the people of the future the data created by the people of today
	* Examples
	* "Your grandmother has a great recipe for preserves? Great!. We can preserve it with no expiry date. For one dollar per page."
	* "You have shoe boxes full of old high school photos. Make them available to all your classmates"
* We Develop and document methods, standards and tools usable by anybody
	* Fingers crossed, business develops and we get customers
* Get everything online, indexed and viewable
	* API nice
	* Two or more long term cloud storage places
* Keep it simple....
* We are: Thoughtful/Local/Practical
* We are: sustainable, detailed and kind
* We create systems that help people do the metadata work to make this process flow smoother


### Vision

* Peeps know more about each other
* Can we create a product that is a more user friendly model than Evernote?


And

_We need to continue Mark's questioning regarding the meaning of all this_
