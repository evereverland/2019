# 2022-04-15 Theo Notes

## Cynthia's wedding

* Wedding is April 30
* I will be highly distracted until about a week after
* Communication will continue, but may be spotty

## Biography

* For Nineties and later, I have enough of an online record that I can create a reasonable outline timeline.
* Might take an hour per year to create
* To decide: Do the entire decade "cold" in an hour or wait until timeline is finished?


## JIT History

* See: https://evereverland.github.io/#journal/2022-04-14-just-in-time-history.md
* I will be delighted to spend an hour or so on this topic
* "Usable past" and "fashionable history" are mental models that will be handy to embed somewhere in EEL
* Teaching youngsters how to make history - as a craft, as a survival tool

## Right to a Permanent record

* See note: https://evereverland.github.io/#journal/2022-04-14-right-to-a-permanent-record.md
* "It's all written in the big book"
* As close to going to heaven as you will get
* Becomes the overarching credo of EEL
* Might include you DNA sequence
