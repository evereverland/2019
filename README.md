# EverEverLand Read Me


_Mission: To enable individuals and families, using digital media, to knit together the threads of a life to preserve memories and artefacts for posterity. What is remembered, lives._


## What this website is about

This website is about EverEverLand, a project created by and for people with the intention of helping themselves and others to archive public and personal data that may be of interest to future historians and future people in general.

Fingers crossed that this project actually becomes a real start up. there is already the first paying customer - one of the founders.

## Where to start

There are a number of disparate elements to this project and it is all stil at early work-in-progess stage. A good place to start is with the frequently asked questions (FAQ) available in the menu to the left.

## How this website is built

This website is built around a very rudimentary content management system written entirely in plain vanilla JavaScript and hosted on GitHub.

The goal is that all project members may be able to add and edit all the material in this website. it should enable both the new user and the expert user to add value in their own ways.

## What this website provides

* Notes of meetings and other time related posts
* Links of Interest
* Hosting for online scripts that may be of use or just for the fun of it
* And any papers and documents that may be of interest to the project
