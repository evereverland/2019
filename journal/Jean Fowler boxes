#Jean Fowler boxes

Over two months have elapsed since we triaged Jean's archive and a week since my latest request of Darra Hofman at SJSU whether she'd made any progress finding a student to catalogue the collection and find repositories for as much of it as possible. I think it's time we out this one to bed -- and restored the sqquare footage of your room. I suggest that I do it. Ideally, I would come over to the Heritage and work through the boxes in the library. Do you think that's possible? (I wouldn't relish being masked all that time, but there we are.) Alternatively, I could bring, say, three at a time back home. I think that would require only a couple of trips, as at least two of the boxes (in my memory) are of books on Afghanistan so I'd first approach the Asia Foundation about them. What do you think?
