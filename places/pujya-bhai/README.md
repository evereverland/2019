# Pujya Bhai

Welcome to a web site dedicated to the life and teachings of Pujya Bhai.

Shri Nathalal H. Joshi, reverentially and lovingly known as Pujya Bhai, was born on 4 October 1920 in the town of [Junagadh]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junagadh ) in the Western state of [Gujarat]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat ), India. Pujya Bhai left his mortal body on 19 May 2013.

```
		The attainment of perfect happiness
		Is possible only through God.
		Because God is perfect,
		While the world is imperfect.

		Expectations are many;
		Not all are met
		There is always a conflict
		In the efforts to satisfy desires.
		The sting of unfilled wants is felt;
		The mind is disturbed.

		The Presence of God alone is
		The highest summit of peace.
```
