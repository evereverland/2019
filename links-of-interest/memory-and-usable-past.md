# Memory, history and a usable past

## Howard Zinn

SC + TA: From "red diaper baby" to _eminence rouge_.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Zinn
> Howard Zinn (August 24, 1922 – January 27, 2010) was an American historian, playwright, philosopher, socialist thinker and World War II veteran. He was chair of the history and social sciences department at Spelman College, and a political science professor at Boston University. Zinn wrote over 20 books, including his best-selling and influential _A People's History of the United States_ in 1980. In 2007, he published a version of it for younger readers, A Young People's History of the United States.

>A People's History of the United States is a 1980 nonfiction book by American historian and political scientist Howard Zinn. In the book, Zinn presented what he considered to be a different side of history from the more traditional "fundamental nationalist glorification of country". Zinn portrays a side of American history that can largely be seen as the exploitation and manipulation of the majority by rigged systems that hugely favor a small aggregate of elite rulers from across the orthodox political parties.
>
>A People's History has been assigned as reading in many high schools and colleges across the United States. It has also resulted in a change in the focus of historical work, which now includes stories that previously were ignored. The book was a runner-up in 1980 for the National Book Award. It frequently has been revised, with the most recent edition covering events through 2005. In 2003, Zinn was awarded the Prix des Amis du Monde Diplomatique for the French version of this book _Une histoire populaire des États-Unis_. More than two million copies have been sold.

TA: _Much as I admire the phrase "usable past", the text to this essay does really provide a meaning or definition to the phrase that feels useful. My guess is that other writers picked up the phrase and gave - and still give - it definition and context and redefinition over some period of time._

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass-Observation
>Mass-Observation is a United Kingdom social research project; originally the name of an organisation which ran from 1937 to the mid-1960s, and was revived in 1981 at the University of Sussex.
>
>Mass-Observation originally aimed to record everyday life in Britain through a panel of around 500 untrained volunteer observers who either maintained diaries or replied to open-ended questionnaires (known as directives). They also paid investigators to anonymously record people's conversation and behaviour at work, on the street and at various public occasions including public meetings and sporting and religious events.

> In The Splendid and the Vile, his new book about Winston Churchill, London, and The Blitz, Erik Larson uses many diaries and accounts from the archives of Mass Observation, described by Larson as “organization launched in Britain two years before the war that recruited hundreds of volunteers to keep daily diaries with the goal of helping sociologists better understand ordinary British life.”
