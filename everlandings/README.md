# EverLandings Read Me

Your afterlife sampler. A selection of web presences we have built for people that may last until the end of time.

"Everlandings" is a clumsy name. Before it was called "Places". How about "[Elysian Fields]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elysium )"? Or "Heaven"? "Paradise"?

***

Possible subtitles might include:

The "here and now" for your "there and then"

Long from now and close by, there you were ...

Bridge over the River Styx

The pearly gates to your living memorial
