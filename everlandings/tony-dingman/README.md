# Tony Dingman

A home page for the poems of Tony Dingman.

A drinking buddy with whom I'm a big fan.

Every day he writes a rhyme.

Perhaps until the end of time.

Here's hoping he writes much better than I can.



Linkt to the repository with the poems: [Tony Dingman]( https://tony-dingman.github.io )
