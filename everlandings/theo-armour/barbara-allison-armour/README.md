## Theo Armour's Recollections

My great aunt Barbara Armour Lowrie - named after her grandmother - told me two things that I remember about her grandmother:

* Barbara was known as "Madam Armour" and the the other Armour (the meat-packing one) was know as "Mrs Armour".
* Barbara had a pet canary that would ride along on the train of her dress

I inherited a number of wrks from my Armour side that may have been acquired by George and Barbara - if not their descendants.

Also

* She outlived most of her children
* One son, George, went to Andover School in Massachusetts. Another son, Allison, went to the Harvard School in Chicago
* Her house on Lake Shore Drive was designed by her son-in-law Francis Whitehouse


## A Collection of Note

Barbara and her husband George are the positive outcomes of a rags to riches story. Just fifteen years after her first arrival in small town in the American midwest, Waukegan IL, she had her portrait painted in London by a renowned portraitist - Sir Lawrence Alma Tadema. Thirty years later she sat for the Swedish artist, Anders Zorn. She commissions a portrait painted by C PA Healy and a bas-relief by an unknown sculptor of one of her sons.

It would be nice if the works listed on this page could stay together as a collection.

Given that George was the first president of the Chicago Art Institute, it makes sense that the Institute should receive the works as a collection.

From newspaper clipping attached to back

> This morning, John William Armour, son of George Armour, esq, in the 14th year of his age, this dear boy was long and invalid, often suffering acute pain; But he bore it all with patience and resignation. He had a beautiful face, sweet disposition and was singularly intelligent and refined. His conscious was alive to the demands of duty and we believe that in his heart was the right in the sight of God. Several since his father took him to Europe with the hope that change of climate would restore his health, but the hope was disappointed and he has just returned home to die. The time and place of the funeral will be duly announced in the papers.

In pencil under the clipping: "Died May 16, 1865"
