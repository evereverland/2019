## Notes on Dates

Gainsborough Dupont

* Twelve years younger that Hugh Percy.
* First published portraits start to appear circa 1780

Hugh Percy

* The man in the portrait appears to be in twenties and is in civilian clothes
	* Percy was in his twenties 1762 to 1772
	* He studied at Cambridge University starting 1760. Married in 1764
* By 1780 Percy would have been in his late thirties or early forties and  general
* Percy had already been painted by Batoni circa 1775 in uniform

## Appearance

* Wikipedia: "He was physically unattractive, being overly thin and having a large nose."
* Painting: The subject is not fat and does not have a small nose

## Frame

* Rococo frame likely to be from 1750 to 1780

## Theo's thoughts

* From 1760 to 1764 Dupont was age 6 to 10 - too young to paint Percy
* Possibility: The painting is by Thomas Gainsborough - who had painted the first Duke in 1750
* Possibility: The painting is of an unknown young man painted by Gainsborough Dupont artist
* Possibility: The painting is of an unknown young man painted by an unknown artist

Next action

* Look for 1983 appraisal for my mother's estate to see if there are any more details.
