## New home for old things

Yesterday, Mark and I discussed finding new homes is 25 boxes of family possessions and for my detecto scales and for my Logitech cameras. as I was getting up this morning, remembering this gave me salt that perhaps the mission of ever ever land may be broader than just finding digital homes for old pieces of paper.

of course all of these items might just be recycled or send to a thrift shop or sold on eBay. and higher-end items might be sold at auction houses. the thing is that there is more at stake than just getting rid of things.

I look at a good number of the Family Treasures that I have and I wonder about them. how does this thing get into my family?who made it? who in my family has had to get in its possession? where has this item lived itself?

I would like to be able to attach to all pieces that I have that I considered Treasures something like the following

* who in my family acquired the piece? and who from? and where?
* who made the piece and is it really of Interest?
* the ability to attach this information to the object without an expiry date
    * crafts using a QR code?
