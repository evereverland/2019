Hi Eleni

Sorry for the very slow reply. Thank you for your detailed update.

Zayed National Museum: Wow! I imagine a project with a ton of interesting complexities. I hope it's fun and not too stressful.

Also, it's so sad to hear about the issues with the National Trust. I spent many happy days during my ten years in London visiting Trust properties.

As for me, after doing eight years on the PGC advisory board, I decided that spending my time with people who were finished making their money and were passing their time spending their money was not the most fun use of my time.

So I returned to a lifelong passion: writing software. I build apps that help to take architect's CAD files over to engineering analysis programs for doing heat, light, ventilation and energy analysis. All the programs I write are free, open source and available to anybody on the Internet. My apps have hundreds of users. I feel I am productive and useful.

Being disabled and 74, I decided that looking after myself is a task best left to others, so I moved into this place - a building in San Francisco designed by Julia Morgan. The good news is that I was one of the first to be vaccinated and I will always have a hundred friends living and dining with me.

Question: One of my projects is to find happy new homes for my tiny collection of art. My primary motive is take works that have been hidden in private houses for centuries and make them available to the public - with a regard for profit not being a material consideration. Here is an example: I would like a portrait of the second Duke of Northumberland painted by Gainsborough Dupont to go from hanging in my living room to hanging in Syon House. I am looking for a consultant - who I will be pleased to compensate fully - who may advise on this process. Is there anybody that comes to mind for you who might be interested several little projects like this?

Hello Lawrence Fine Art Services

This is to report that the crating and moving your firm carried out last Friday is great evidence for why you were recommended to us by Jennifer Biederbeck of Sotheby's San Francisco.

Your estimates prepared by Dan were detailed yet clear and produced in a timely manner. The curation by Liz and the packing and crating by Wendell, Jesse and Brandon were a joy that I was glad to be a part of.  They did more than just pack. They appreciated, were knowledgeable and inquired about the works as they packed. They conveyed absolute respect for the art they were packing. They confirmed that we have placed our trust in the right organization.

By the way, Moses's crates are treasures in themselves.

Live long and prosper!
