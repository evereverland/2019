# EverEverLand Read Me


## What this website is about

This website is about ever ever land, a project created by for people with the intention of helping themselves and others to archive public and personal data that could be of interest to future historians and future people in general.

Fingers crossed that this project actually becomes a real start up. there is already the first paying customer - one of the founders.


## How this website is built

This website is built around a very rudimentary content management system written entirely in plain vanilla JavaScript and hosted on GitHub.

The goal is that all project members may be able to add and edit all the material in this website. it should enable both the new user and the expert user to add value in their own ways.

## What this website provides

* Notes of meetings and other time related posts
* Links of Interest
* hosting for online scripts that may be of use or just for the fun of it
* and any papers and documents that may be of interest to the project
