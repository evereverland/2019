The local bookstore selling to a general audience is dead. Rents are getting higher. The number of books that can be displayed is reduced. At the same time, the range of interest of even the smallest population increases.

At best the local store becomes order takers.

What is the alternative?

The owner of the store closes the shopfront and specializes. The more niche the better.

At first the business specializes in reselling books. The business becomes know for works on the Peloponnesian wars written in the 18th century, early 20th century communism in the States, works in german on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation or whatever, Fulfillment including shipping and taxes is by the usual suspects. The owners manage forums and assist in promulgating the arcane knowledge the revel in.

After a time there is sufficient interest such that they can generate new works. Imagine a crowd-funding project with a thousand share for $100 each. The funds will finance a new project to published the hitherto unpublished letters of a luminary. certain anchor shareholders acquire dozens of share; others pool funds to acquire a single share. All investors are honored when the work is published and their names are recorded as part of the work.

Eventually readings meetings are organized at various locations around the world.

At some time the works cease being books and transform into sources of pure knowledge.
