# EverEverLand as a Start-Up

We say that EverEverLand is a start-up. But do we really want to be a start-up?

The "traditional" idea of a start-up is that somebody comes up with a disruptive idea and builds a convincing demo; venture capitalists love the idea and invest millions; after a year or two the start-up employs thousands and "serves" millions; the founders are billionaires and capitalism prospers.

We have seen this model work downs of times - and we sigh upon remembering the hundreds (thousands?) of failures.

Are there any alternate paths to success? Are there other models that may be followed. I believe there are - and I believe there are successful models for success available in the history of commerce, economics and politics.

Having said that, I currently see these models "though a glass darkly". The path to attaining a clearer vision is nonetheless available, engaging and fun: making a hundred thought experiments bloom.

## Thought Experiment

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment

> A thought experiment is a hypothetical situation in which a hypothesis, theory,[a] or principle is laid out for the purpose of thinking through its consequences.

> The right way to deal with new ideas is to treat them as a challenge to your imagination â€” not just to have lower standards, but to switch polarity entirely, from listing the reasons an idea won't work to trying to think of ways it could. That's what I do when I meet people with new ideas. I've become quite good at it, but I've had a lot of practice. Being a partner at Y Combinator means being practically immersed in strange-sounding ideas proposed by unknown people. Every six months you get thousands of new ones thrown at you and have to sort through them, knowing that in a world with a power-law distribution of outcomes, it will be painfully obvious if you miss the needle in this haystack. Optimism becomes urgent.

## Let a hundred flowers bloom

>"The policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend is designed to promote the flourishing of the arts and the progress of science."

## Historical Examples

Doctors, lawyers and priests are groups where people carved out prestigious roles for themselves but where there were fewer billionaires and fewer poor. The average practitioner is comfortable if no wealthy. Some accountants, engineers and other may also achieve similar rank and prestige

Helping create new professions - specialist with recognized credentials - may be an interesting path to follow.

## Current examples

Free and open-source software may offer a variety of economic models to follow. These may be discussed in future thought "nibbles"


### Free and open-source software

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software

> Free and open-source software (FOSS) is software that is both free software and open-source software where anyone is freely licensed to use, copy, study, and change the software in any way, and the source code is openly shared so that people are encouraged to voluntarily improve the design of the software. This is in contrast to proprietary software, where the software is under restrictive copyright licensing and the source code is usually hidden from the users.

## Dealing with thought experiments

The successful gambit with thought experiments is to run with them, to help them move forward, to step up the pace, to push the ideas to their logical extremes.

Finding flaws, providing rebuttals and offering negative thoughts are not usually helpful. Trying to defend an idea that is imaginary and half-formed is not easy - and may cause one of the hundred flowers not to bloom. This would be sad.

A far happier alternative is to propose a counter thought experiment - and then compare and contrast the two

Bye for now...
