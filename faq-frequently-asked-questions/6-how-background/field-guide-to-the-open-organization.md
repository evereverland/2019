# Field Guide to the Open Organization

## Preface

When you are a part of a venture-capital-backed, for profit startup, the general path forward is moderately clear: You get lawyers, incorporate in Delaware, prepare for the IPO roadshow and learn to pirate your super yacht around the Seychelles islands.

The path, the organization and the ethics of an "open organization" are less clear. This paper (currently just a set of brief notes) is a work-in-progress that, fingers-crossed, may one day provide some useful guidance toward building an organization that is responsible:

* Fiscally
* Environmentally
* Socially

Ideally this document provides a checklist of items and metrics to be considered and continuously monitored. The list is short, but not too short. The list is authoritative and provides links that may be used to verify and provide background on each and every item asserted here,


## Definitions


### Field Guide

Wikipedia:

> A field guide is a book designed to help the reader identify wildlife (plants or animals) or other objects of natural occurrence (e.g. minerals). It is generally designed to be brought into the 'field' or local area where such objects exist to help distinguish between similar objects. Field guides are often designed to help users distinguish animals and plants that may be similar in appearance but are not necessarily closely related.
