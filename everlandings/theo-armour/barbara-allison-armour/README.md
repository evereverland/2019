From newspaper clipping attached to back

> This morning, John William Armour, son of George Armour, esq, in the 14th year of his age, this dear boy was long and invalid, often suffering acute pain; But he bore it all with patience and resignation. He had a beautiful face, sweet disposition and was singularly intelligent and refined. His conscious was alive to the demands of duty and we believe that in his heart was the right in the sight of God. Several since his father took him to Europe with the hope that change of climate would restore his health, but the hope was disappointed and he has just returned home to die. The time and place of the funeral will be duly announced in the papers.

In pencil under the clipping: "Died May 16, 1865"
