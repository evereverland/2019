# Genealogy Current Thoughts


## Questions

Who is trying to reinvent genealogy? Are there active groups of people who try to reimagine the purpose and benefits of genealogy? If so, who are they? How do we get in touch with them?

Is there an online forum where people talk about these thing?

## DNA tests

Is 23andme.com good enough? Should you try others? If so, who?

## GEDCOM Rules?

If we are to build stuff for the metaverse and all sorts of future stuff, then we will need "machine readable" sources of data. (Yes, with AI anything can be parsed - but while we are waiting, what to do we do? ). GEDCOM seems to be it

Is there an app that allows you to copy and paste the text from Norah's email and derive a valid gedcom file?

Once we have a good number of gedcom files, we can do all manner of wonderful things! Fingers crossed!

## Personal

How close is George Armour to Jeanne Armour?
Is James C Marshall Shirk related to chief justice John Marshall?
