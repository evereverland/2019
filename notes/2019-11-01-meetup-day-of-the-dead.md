Santayana said: "Those who do not learn from history, are doomed to repeat it." Shucks, I'm just her to provide the course material

The historian of the future

Age of Enlightenment, men of reason

The more an organism knows itself, about itself the better it can coach itself

I have over five thousand business cards. Just by knowing these names were associated with me you can connect the dots that create the business, cultural and political links

Ditto books, bookmarks, baseball cards, collections and more

	* Ditto Wikimedia Commons and a multitude of items

* Collections of 3D clip art to used to generate animations in Cinema4D and other similar programs along with examples of and guidance with their use




## The how: Sell then design then build

Getting VC's to fund us is a very unlikely prospect, so ever ever land will have to bootstrap itself. A Way Forward might be like this:

*Task of finding 10-15 early adopters (help us find the problem/what they need/what they're lacking)

* "Sell then design then build"

This idea comes from:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conner_Peripherals
* https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/27/business/a-novel-idea-customer-satisfaction.html
* http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/conner-peripherals-inc-history/
	* Conner set about building a company--Conner Peripherals--around a 'sell, design, build' strategy.
	* Conner continued its policy of not engineering a new product unless at least one major buyer had agreed to purchase it
* https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1990/08/13/73904/index.htm
	* Conner has learned to win by turning conventional wisdom upside down.
	* 'Sell, design, build' is the company's business formula -- in that order.
	* To marry itself to customers and justify R&D expense, Conner won't engineer a new product unless a major buyer has already spoken for it.

Has anybody else ever succeeded using 'sell design build'?

if we're going to start by selling then we have to persuade some people of our worthy cause.



### Science Of Persuasion

Watch this very fun video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFdCzN7RYbw

First pass at writing notes on the video
1. Reciprocity.
	* Obligation to give when you receive.
	* Be the first to give.
	* Personalized and unexpected.
	* When you ask, likely to say "yes"
2. Scarcity.
	* If it's scarce, we want it more.
	* People want more of those things there are less of
	* Use this by highlighting the Benefits, Uniqueness and Possible Loss.
3. Authority.
	* We are more likely to comply with a request if it is coming from a perceived authority/expert.
	* People will follow the lead of credible, knowledgeable experts
4. Consistency.
	* We want to be consistent with our past commitments, even if the initial commitment is much smaller.
	* Looking for commitments that can be made
5. Liking.
	* We like people who are similar, who give us compliments and who co-operate with us.
	* People who are similar to us
	* People who pay us compliments
	* People who cooperate with us
6. Consensus
	* If others (especially similar others) are doing it, then we are more likely to do it ourselves.
	* People will look to the actions of others to determine their own

## The what: Operations, deliverables and processes

* Find out focus, carve out our goal, and set our target on that. It's okay if we don't hit it, but a direction with a clear cut focus will keep us on track and prevent us from straying.
* Keep it simple....


## The who

* Task of finding 10-15 early adopters (help us find the problem/what they need/what they're lacking) participating fairly regularly
* Perhaps a hundred or so "lurkers" participating quite occasionally


## The when

* three months or so to gather the early adopters
