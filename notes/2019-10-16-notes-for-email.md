## Current objectives

* Create sufficient content and a good-enough user experience such that we are happy to share the experience with others
    * What does it mean to "share the experience"
        * Recommend the software
        * Recommend the content
        * Have an shared experience
            * which experience, experiences to be created are possible shared ones?
* Content might include
    * A variety of use cases
    * 'how-to' or FAQ that guides you to suitable collections and metadata for the suggested uses cases
* User experience might include enhancements or makeovers to evereverland.gitlab.io

## Use Cases

* Wikipedia:[Use Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case )

In software and systems engineering, a use case is:

* A list of actions or event steps typically defining the interactions between a role (known as an "actor") and a system to achieve a goal. The actor can be a human or other external system.
* A particular form or pattern or exemplar of usage, a scenario that begins with some user of the system initiating some transaction or sequence of interrelated events

We need to establish a number of use cases for EverEverland with the intent that the uses cases help to define and organize an EverEverLand mission and vision

Use cases might include

* Making a available a curated list of reading material covering various scientific, linguistic and philosophical topics
* Recording the recipes of a Basque family adapted for use in the US along with traditional guidelines for their usage
* Collections of 3D clip art to used to generate animations in Cinema4D and other similar programs along with examples of and guidance with their use


## Collections

* Collections are the ['folders']( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_(computing)#Folder_metaphor ) or the 'topics' of the archive
* [Collections]( https://archive.org/services/docs/api/items.html?highlight=collections#collections )" "All items must be part of a collection. A collection is simply an item with special characteristics. Items can be assigned to a collection at the time of creation, or after the item has been created"
* We need to identify likely candidate collections for the use cases


## Metadata

* [Metadata]( https://archive.org/services/docs/api/metadata.html ) items are the ['tags']( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata) ) of the archives
* We need to identify likely candidate metadata items for the use cases
