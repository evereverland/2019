just-in-time history / historiography / meta-history


JIT history is the bringing together as many references to the widest range of sources as possible in response to the question currently at hand. The resources may have little or everything to do with the prior or the next question; they are merely singularly focussed on the discussion of the moment; They do not hide but reveal the bias of the investigation.

>The just-in-time (JIT) inventory system is a management strategy that aligns raw-material orders from suppliers directly with production schedules. Companies employ this inventory strategy to increase efficiency and decrease waste by receiving goods only as they need them for the production process, which reduces inventory costs. This method requires producers to forecast demand accurately.

>In his Poetics, Aristotle (384â€“322 BCE) maintained the superiority of poetry over history because poetry speaks of what ought or must be true rather than merely what is true.

Alternative alternatives

What present might there be if the past wer changed? Example: Axis win WW

What past could occur so that we arrive at the current present from a different start. Example: being born rich instead of poor yet having the same outcome.

What are some of the possible alternative futures?
