# Right to a permanent record


If there is ever a an update to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights then the following will be a worthy addition

_Everyone has the right to a permanent record of important life events such as birth, death and marriage._


See UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights

https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights

>Article 25
>Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.

## What are the minimum and maximum permanent records?

### Minimum

A minimum record might consist of

* Date and place of birth with IDs for parents
* Date and place of death
* Date and record of place of residence
* Other data aas required by local laws
* Minimum date requested or not

Anyone may request a minimum permanent record

A maximum record might consist of

* Everything imaginable
* Free to start
* Pay when you go over a limit
* Cause no harm to others



## What are some of the rules for permanent records?

In a dream utopia, here are some of the guidelines:

* There is no off switch
* There are so many copies in so many places that destroying many can have little impact on the whole
* There the amount of data that may be very huge
* There is a mechanism for creating new copies, storing new data and retrieving existing data
* Whenever the data in one instance is updated, all the other instances are updated soon thereafter
* All processing is available at no charge to the public
* All tools are free and open source
* Data is managed by revision control systems such as [Git]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git )
	* This has many implications that will be discussed
* All data is updated via the services of trusted maintainers

Not to forget:

### The map is not the territory

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation#%22A_map_is_not_the_territory%22
>The map–territory relation describes the relationship between an object and a representation of that object, as in the relation between a geographical territory and a map of it. Polish-American scientist and philosopher Alfred Korzybski remarked that "the map is not the territory" and that "the word is not the thing", encapsulating his view that an abstraction derived from something, or a reaction to it, is not the thing itself. Korzybski held that many people do confuse maps with territories, that is, confuse models of reality with reality itself. These ideas are crucial to General Semantics, a system Korzybski originated.
>
>The relationship has also been expressed in other terms, such as "The model is not the data" or Alan Watts' "The menu is not the meal."




## What are some permanent record projects in operation today?

Here are links to some current projects that relate to recording and keeping data for very long periods of time:

* https://archiveprogram.github.com/
> As today’s vital code becomes yesterday’s historical curiosity, it may be abandoned, forgotten, or lost. Worse, albeit much less likely, in the case of global catastrophe, we could lose everything stored on modern media in a few generations. Archiving software across multiple organizations and forms of storage helps to ensure its long-term preservation.
* https://www.softwareheritage.org/
> Our ambition is to collect, preserve, and share all software that is publicly available in source code form. On this foundation, a wealth of applications can be built, ranging from cultural heritage to industry and research.
* https://longnow.org/
> The Long Now Foundation
is a nonprofit established in 01996 to foster long-term thinking.
>
>Our work encourages imagination at the timescale of civilization — the next and last 10,000 years —
a timespan we call the long now.
* https://archive.org/about/
> The Internet Archive, a 501(c)(3) non-profit, is building a digital library of Internet sites and other cultural artifacts in digital form. Like a paper library, we provide free access to researchers, historians, scholars, people with print disabilities, and the general public. Our mission is to provide Universal Access to All Knowledge.
>
>We began in 1996 by archiving the Internet itself, a medium that was just beginning to grow in use. Like newspapers, the content published on the web was ephemeral - but unlike newspapers, no one was saving it. Today we have 25+ years of web history accessible through the Wayback Machine and we work with 950+ library and other partners through our Archive-It program to identify important web pages.
* https://www.gharchive.org/
> Open-source developers all over the world are working on millions of projects: writing code & documentation, fixing & submitting bugs, and so forth. GH Archive is a project to record the public GitHub timeline, archive it, and make it easily accessible for further analysis.
* https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-silica/
> The demand for long-term data storage in the cloud is reaching unprecedented levels, and continues to grow into the zettabytes. Existing storage technologies do not provide a cost-effective solution for storing long-lived data. Operating at such scales in the cloud requires a fundamental re-thinking of how we build large-scale storage systems, as well as the underlying storage technologies that underpin them.

Project Silica is developing the first-ever storage technology designed and built from the media up, for the cloud. We are leveraging recent discoveries in ultrafast laser optics to store data in quartz glass by using femtosecond lasers, and building a completely new storage system designed from scratch around this technology. This opens up an incredibly exciting opportunity to challenge and completely re-think traditional storage system design, and to co-design the future hardware and software infrastructure for the cloud.


## What are some examples of permanent record thinking?

Representations of self have occurred ever since the beginning. Perhaps it starts with making babies. When the first humanoid first recognized themselves looking while at a reflection in a puddle, the desire to keep a permanent record was created [thinking out loud].

The permanent record we discuss here is likely to be simple in the near future and unimaginable five thousand years from now.

At some time in the not too distant future it will be possible to create a representation of heaven that correlates nearly perfectly with whatever heaven you want to imagine.

People have been pondering the permanent record of a human for a while. Here are some observations


### Book of Life

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Life
> In Christianity and Judaism, the Book of Life is the book in which God records the names of every person who is destined for Heaven and the World to Come. According to the Talmud it is open on Rosh Hashanah, as is its analog for the wicked, the Book of the Dead. For this reason, extra mention is made for the Book of Life during Amidah recitations during the Days of Awe, the ten days between Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year, and Yom Kippur, the day of atonement (the two High Holidays, particularly in the prayer Unetaneh Tokef).

### Heaven
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven
>Heaven or the heavens, is a common religious cosmological or transcendent supernatural place where beings such as gods, angels, souls, saints, or venerated ancestors are said to originate, be enthroned, or reside. According to the beliefs of some religions, heavenly beings can descend to Earth or incarnate and earthly beings can ascend to Heaven in the afterlife or, in exceptional cases, enter Heaven alive.
>
>Heaven is often described as a "highest place", the holiest place, a Paradise, in contrast to hell or the Underworld or the "low places" and universally or conditionally accessible by earthly beings according to various standards of divinity, goodness, piety, faith, or other virtues or right beliefs or simply divine will. Some believe in the possibility of a heaven on Earth in a world to come.
>
>Another belief is in an axis mundi or world tree which connects the heavens, the terrestrial world, and the underworld. In Indian religions, heaven is considered as Svarga loka,[1] and the soul is again subjected to rebirth in different living forms according to its karma. This cycle can be broken after a soul achieves Moksha or Nirvana. Any place of existence, either of humans, souls or deities, outside the tangible world (Heaven, Hell, or other) is referred to as the otherworld.

### Angel

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel
> An angel is a supernatural spiritual being who, according to various religions, is God's servant.
>
>Abrahamic religions often depict angels as benevolent celestial intermediaries between God (or Heaven) and humanity.[1][2] Other roles include protectors and guides for humans, and servants of God.[3] Abrahamic religions describe angelic hierarchies, which vary by religion and sect. Some angels have specific names (such as Gabriel or Michael) or titles (such as seraph or archangel). Those expelled from Heaven are called fallen angels, distinct from the heavenly host.
>
>Angels in art are usually shaped like humans of extraordinary beauty.[4] They are often identified in Christian artwork with bird wings,[5] halos,[6] and divine light.


### Digital Twin

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin
> A digital twin is a virtual representation that serves as the real-time digital counterpart of a physical object or process. Though the concept originated earlier (attributed to Michael Grieves, then of the University of Michigan, in 2002) the first practical definition of digital twin originated from NASA in an attempt to improve physical model simulation of spacecraft in 2010. Digital twins are the result of continual improvement in the creation of product design and engineering activities. Product drawings and engineering specifications progressed from handmade drafting to computer aided drafting/computer aided design to model-based systems engineering.
>
>The digital twin of a physical object is dependent on the digital thread—the lowest level design and specification for a digital twin—and the "twin" is dependent on the digital thread to maintain accuracy. Changes to product design are implemented using engineering change orders (ECO). An ECO made to a component item will result in a new version of the item's digital thread, and correspondingly to the digital twin.


### Metaverse

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse
> A metaverse is a network of 3D virtual worlds focused on social connection.[1][2][3] In futurism and science fiction, it is often described as a hypothetical iteration of the Internet as a single, universal virtual world that is facilitated by the use of virtual and augmented reality headsets.[4][1]
>
>The term "metaverse" has its origins in the 1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash as a portmanteau of "meta" and "universe." Various metaverses have been developed for popular use such as virtual world platforms like Second Life.[5] Some metaverse iterations involve integration between virtual and physical spaces and virtual economies.[1] Demand for increased immersion means metaverse development is often linked to advancing virtual reality technology.[6][7][8]
>
>The term has been used as a buzzword[9][4][10] to exaggerate development progress of various related technologies and projects for public relations purposes.[11] Information privacy, user addiction, and user safety are concerns within metaverses, stemming from challenges facing the social media and video game industries as a whole


### Homunculus

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homunculus
> A homunculus ( "little person") is a representation of a small human being, originally depicted as small statues made out of clay. Popularized in sixteenth-century alchemy and nineteenth-century fiction, it has historically referred to the creation of a miniature, fully formed human. The concept has roots in preformationism as well as earlier folklore and alchemic traditions. The term is also used for an image of a person with the size of the body parts distorted to represent how much area of the cerebral cortex of the brain is devoted to it. For example, the legs are small but the mouth and hands are large.


### "Inner Voice"

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrapersonal_communication
>Intrapersonal communication is the process by which an individual communicates within themselves, acting as both sender and receiver of messages, and encompasses the use of unspoken words to consciously engage in self-talk and inner speech.
