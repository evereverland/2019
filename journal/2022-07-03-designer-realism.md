# 2022-07-03 Designer Realism

There are many types of realism.

See a list of them here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism

There are likely to be several existing definitions that encompass what I am about to talk about, but taking the time to identify these will take time. So I will create my own term: "design realism".


## What is design realism

_The following is a work-in-progress definition._

Design realism is a way of looking at the things that people currently do and how they live now with the intent of coming up with processes or products that may seamlessly enter people lives with little or no cost, effort or learning yet in turn help create new jobs or consultancies or teaching roles and help make the world a better place to live.

## Examples of design realists and their designs

* Sir Tim Berners-Lee and the World Wide Web
* Linus Torvalds and Linux AND Git
* Guido van Rossum and the Python Programming language
* Multiple efforts and the bicycle
* Two teams and Arduino and Raspberry PI HW
* More examples and links to come

One could say that the Buddha, Jesus Christ and similar may have been a design realists

## What design realism is not

* Design realism is not likely to be something venture capitalists want to fund
* Design realism is about being free and open; not about being secretive and proprietary
* etc

## The background: Normal people normally doings normal things

> Humans are allergic to change. They love to say, "We've always done it this way." I try to fight that. That's why I have a clock on my wall that runs counter-clockwise.

People in general mostly understand: what you *want* to see happen is unlikely to happen. What actually will happen is very likely to be very different than what you wish and hope for.

As people mature they become accustomed to not always winning first prize or winning the game or being elected president.

What happens, though, when people are asked to plan for the future is different. For the most part they plan for a future that mimics past successes. They want a house that looks like the pretty houses in the photos on the web site. They want the same pizza they have had a hundred time before. People support the same team they supported last year.

People may want a palace but will settle for a house as nice as the one they grew up in.

All this is how the normal world normally operates. People go about their daily tasks and they like it that way.

Then out of the blue sky comes fire, the wheel, the Buddha or the automobile or the Internet and for no good reason, everything changes.


## There are new normals

At the same time, living here in America, we have seen Amazon replace Barnes & Noble which replaced the local bookstore. We have seen the pizza chain in the mall replace the down town pizzeria. We have seen CraigsList and Facebook replace the local newspaper.

And it's not just the physical world changing. We have moved on from letters to telegrams to faxes to email to chat to zoom.

For most people, all is the above is the norm and it's all acceptable. Government at all levels, large companies, the banks, insurers and speculators jiggle and juggle zillions of factors so that you may eat your Subway sandwich, watching TikTok videos on your iPhone in a mall that newly opened just that day. Yet you feel it has always been this way.


## We can't go back

And no matter how hard we may *want* those good things of the old days to return - such a prospect is highly unlikely.

## Rules are changed - for everybody

But what if you own that local bookstore or were a reporter for the newspaper or supplied the dough for the pizzeria? Things are likely to be a bit tricky. Many have folded or gone away. Walk down the main street of the old downtown, look at all the shops for rent or boarded up. Is there anybody else there?

At the same time the demand for art books and hand-printed materials is booming, the demand for bloggers and great writing is booming, the outsourcing of delivery and fulfillment services to local entrepreneurs is booming.

## What does the marketplace really want?

It is essential to gauge the future not by what you want or I want. We must do our best to discern healthy and viable futures on on the entire current marketplace and opportunities - considering deeply education, income, justice and more.

It is also essential to gauge the future not by what big corporations want - and seemingly increasingly not by what governments - both elected representatives and civil servants.

Much more could be written here about what we don't want. See also reference Machiavelli below,

But at this stage, let us consider: what might we want?


## What can we learn from history so as to un-doom ourselves?

As sort of a case study, let's double-click into a field that is being currently being disrupted: the learning and teaching of history.

The current providers - the everyday history teachers - are not being disrupted much. The disruption is happening outside the classroom. The disruptions are not likely to be caused or even felt by teachers. The only hints may come from the work-product produced by students. These might include: more copy/paste plagiarism, stunningly good papers, more illustrations, extensive background material and even happier students.


Anything interesting going on?

## What has changed?

In high school I remember taking three history classes: American, European and art. My guess is that I took a few more at college - including history of architecture. Most courses used text-only text books. I would not call any course thrilling or even fun. Subsequently, I have probably read no more than a dozen books relating to history.

Yet even from such a small base my knowledge history is probably not that bad. Why?? The cornucopia of historical writings readily available on the Internet has greatly enlarged my perspective.

Personally I mostly use Wikipedia and Google Search to locate authoritative articles with substantive references. I am a self-learner. I tend to teach myself whatever I need to know at the moment it is needed. I call this process just-in-time learning. The interesting thing is that my methods are not at all typical. Therefore it is of the essence that I must *not* try to force my methods on others.

## History is being created and written as we speak

Below are links to some Internet facilities I mostly do not use. In order to make things more interesting I searched to the the terms "history" and "rome". Every link comes up with numerous relevant results.

* https://history.com/search?q=rome
* https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/subject/1211
* https://medium.com/tag/roman-empire
* https://podcasts.google.com/search/history%20rome

* https://facebook.com/groups/romanhistory/
* https://twitter.com/search?q=history%20rome
* https://instagram.com/history_rome/tagged/
* https://tiktok.com/search?q=history%20rome

All of these sites supply material of interest, reasonably intuitive user interfaces, extensive accessible content and full search facilities to narrow the focus. It turns out the world is going through a history boom and most people don't know this!


## What are learning and teaching?

These web experiences disrupt the traditional learning and teaching experience. Almost all the offerings are created by individuals or small teams of enthusiasts.

Below are some randomly copy/pastes of definitions of teaching found on the web. These thoughts were probably drafted to apply to teachers in classrooms. Nevertheless you may apply any these thoughts to any of the above web experiences with no loss of intent or outcome.

* A definition: Teaching is the process of attending to people's needs, experiences and feelings, and intervening so that they learn particular things, and go beyond the given.
* When a person imparts information or skills to another, it is common to
describe the action as teaching.
* Teaching is an intimate contact between the more mature personality and a less mature one.
* Teaching is interpersonal influence aimed at changing the behavior potential of another person.
* Teaching is a social and cultural process, which is planned in order to enable an individual to learn something in his life.

 Much/Most every thing you see in the links above was created this year. People are learning and teaching history in ways with almost zero history. You are watching history in the making!


## Is this wonderful?

As is the case with so much of the Internet, along with the many wonderful treasures there are piles of trash, things that are inconsequential and more,

In the particular endeavor we are looking at - reimagining the learning of history - what is needed are historians who are educated in the processes of creating authoritative histories, who can create lively presentations and be part of the process of managing the history they leave behind.

Fingers crossed the same would happen in other "reimaginings".


## Beware

Design thinking is not for everybody. This is not easy to explain - especially for people who don't get it.

In my experience few people able to consider a future where they do not picture themselves making the choices.

People are reluctant to think about introducing new things into their routines

Many people are great at finding issues with a vision but have little ability to enlarge the vision.

## Conclusion

The closest thought-process I can come up with is Machiavelli's _The Prince_

* https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/subject/1211
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince

But there may be other less evil constructs

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirrors_for_princes
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculum_literature

We are trying to imagining better ways of doing things that are doable which might include the following:

* You can get started for free, today
* The way forward is documented, the processes have full specifications
* There are opportunities for making money by doing work for other or helping the get going themselves or making what they have even better
* Things keep getting better and better because the community is fully engaged
* Everything is free and open source and you can be paid for making things better

Workers of the world unite; you have everything to gain using the links!
