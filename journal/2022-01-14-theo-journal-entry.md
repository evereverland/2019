## George Armour
Here is a link to the notes I prepared for the Wikipedia article I drafted/wrote in 2017: [George Armour]( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TmUhw7slRxGNTpdTVbxc9zANUt7GAthm8acQ3573enI/edit?usp=sharing)

## Open Source History
All the software I build is free open source software - [FOSS]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software ). It seems natural to me that if we create a history then its historiography should also be open. In other words, our dialog is also created to be readily available to you, the historian of 555 years from now or whenever.

Much as I treasure email and mailing lists as written mediums, sharing multiple emails with people not in the original thread over a long period of time is very difficult.

I also like forums but maintaining these and expecting that their data sets may be available a thousand years from now is unlikely

Therefore, I propose the idea that a folder of files may be sufficient. Folders are created by year. Folders for topics are created as necessary. Each file is in the file name format: year-month-day-authorName-topic. Every file name is in standard web file format: all lowercase with hyphens as word separators.

## Name of this Project
“Theo Armour family history project” is a very fine name indeed, but can’t we be even more pretentious? I propose glombing the word “simplicity”? Short for the Thoreau quote:

“Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity! I say, let your affairs be as two or three, and not a hundred or a thousand; instead of a million count half a dozen, and keep your accounts on your thumb-nail.”

Of course this title is a contradiction. The project is not simple and may never be simple. Nonetheless doing something simply just because it may be what it’s all about:

###  See [Messabout]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messabout )

The term is derived from the children's book "The Wind in the Willows", by Kenneth Grahame. In the story, Mole and Rat are rowing up the river in Rat's boat. They are discussing nautical things and life in general when Rat is heard to utter,

>Believe me, my young friend, there is nothing — absolutely nothing — half so much worth doing as simply messing about in boats. Simply messing... about in boats — or with boats. In or out of ’em, it doesn't matter. Nothing seems really to matter, that's the charm of it. Whether you get away, or whether you don't; whether you arrive at your destination or whether you reach somewhere else, or whether you never get anywhere at all, you're always busy, and you never do anything in particular; and when you've done it there's always something else to do, and you can do it if you like, but you'd much better not.

## Timing of Points of Contact

Your responses determine my responses. If you write something that is lengthy and exquisite and I take two days to reply with two words then you know my mind is elsewhere you won’t find much satisfaction. If, on the other hand, you receive back paragraphs within minutes then you know we have a dialog cooking. Lengthy projects have these ups and downs, ins and outs.

_You can schedule trains and planes, but not the brains._
