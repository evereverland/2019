Some interesting thoughts in here for sure Theo. 

Firstly I am absolutely in love with discovering things that I didn't know existed. outwater.com/ seems to be one of those places. 
I have spent hours browsing mcmaster.com looking at the variety of parts and tools available if only you know what you're looking for.

Knowing something exists can often be the first step in solving a problem or thinking in a new way.

That being said, in specific response to your goal of living a monk-like life with limited objects, there is a real creative power in having piles of disjointed junk on hand to follow inspiration in the immediacy. I have multiple memories of going into the junk yard and metal shop and putting together knight armor, javelins, crazy hats and the like. I once cut a barrel apart to make a wearable whiskey barrel for a highland games celebration. 

One of my favorite vulgar Canadian youtubers AvE talks about his "Empire of Dirt" which is a throwback to the Nine Inch Nails song Hurt about lead singer Trent Reznor's drug addiction. 

He is completely content to know that his work might be completely meaningless to history, to his progeny, to the greater society altogether. I'm sure that is a feeling that is easier to hold on to as a younger man, maybe less so later. And while making the world a better place is a fantastic goal to drive your life (eg Cynthia's professional work, and to a lesser extent my own) I believe you can make the world a better place through simple generosity, positivity and beauty. 

However AvE and I to some extent am thoroughly content experiencing the satisfaction that comes from a simple creative breakthrough, a beautiful moment of art, or a good laugh. 

I think there will come a moment, perhaps sooner than later, when I will want to strip my life down to it's parts and free myself from nearly all my possessions. I've been contemplating working for the NPS in Alaska and the idea of moving 3000 miles and making a (even seasonal) life requires a significant re-evaluation of my all my "dirt."

I am not sure if I contributed to this conversation much. Just some thoughts. 

Sorry for the delayed response.

Perhaps I am trying to make up for a profligate childhood where I communicated little because there was little to communicate. But now seems to be a good time to heart the replication of the time of men of letters.
