## 100: Tools For Protecting Peopleâ€™s Legacies After They Die

Preserving your memories, beliefs, personality, and expectations about the future should be cheap and easy today. Storage, preservation, and discoverability are all cheaper and simpler than ever before. Yet every year more than 50 million people die, and the vast majority won't leave this kind of legacy. That's a tragedy.

Preserving personal legacies has value for the people whose legacy is preserved, for the people who get access to these legacies, and for all of us: a clearer understanding of humanity, its values, and experiences. So what could significantly increase preservation of our legacies?

* First, simple tools for collecting the material: A well-designed web form with prompts for significant memories, vital stats, family medical history, ethical will, and so on; and tools for collecting, tagging, and preserving photos, videos, and other media.
* Second, tools, tech, and a plan for long-term preservation.
* Third, a robust system, designed with legal advice, for specifying who gets to access which parts of the legacy and when.
* Fourth, convenient, controlled access to the information.
* Fifth, an effort to promote the project and its reliability.

Each of these five components might require a team of professionals. However, there is such a clear void here that even a proof of concept using simple tools would be a big improvement and demonstrate the value of further investment.

## Observations

The text and the various web sites appear to focus on older individuals and the idea of creating media celebrating or commemorating that person.

There could be more:

* Providing resources for the historian of the future investigating the plight and life of ordinary people
* Capturing multi-generational aspects
* Helping people of all ages records aspects of their lives without having to become hoarders of physical objects.
* Creating new types of jobs relating to the discovery, triage and archiving of personal histories
* Connecting the histories of a number of people observant of the many connections they have had collectively
